This repository 'prototype_reports' contains IUCLID FTL report templates that are currently available for testing. The available reports should be treated as such. The IUCLID team welcomes feedback on the prototype reports concerning the content and/or any generation errors that may occur. If you wish to notify the IUCLID team, please start a Forum discussion in the IUCLID OECD Customisation Forum, stating which report you are referring to and an outline of the problem: https://community.oecd.org/community/iuclidcustomisation
